Smart-UI

## Description

This project devises a UI for a futuristic design of a smart table. Through multiple iterations of interviews and design prototypes, I envision a futuristic table with multiple motors to adjust the height of the table, a simple UI to control the motors, along various functionalities, such as the ability to sync your phone and watch to the UI and charge them at the same time along with your airpods. For the UI, I envision an iPad-like interface with a simple scroll at the top, a customizable home screen depending on the user, an option to add to-do list items and delete them per the user's convenience, a notification block showing different important notifcations, an option to select which user is using the app, along with app icons for the users apple watch, airpods and iphone if/when they're connected.

I envision the smart UI would be sort of a rotateable interface sitting on top the desk, along with a connecter that connects the users devices to the desk. In certain cases, the rotatable device sitting on top of test could potentially be used a secondary monitor.

Thus, after taking in all the feedback, I deciced to base my UI for the smart desk on the follwing:
a) Simple UI with familiar design.
b) Productivity apps such as notes, calender and timer on the main screen.
c) Scroll bar for adjusting the incline of the desk, set for different users.
d) Large desk size with the monitor for the UI be used as a secondary screen.
e) Notification features such as reminding user to take a break, or remdinding them of the homework due. I chose to have a timer on when the homework is due such that it keeps the user on their toes and gives them appropriate time to prepare for it.
f) UI integrates with different apps such as canvas or the calender.
